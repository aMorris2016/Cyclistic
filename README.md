# Cyclistic
Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Project

## Introduction
This is an exploratory data analysis case study about Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company based in Chicago. Working as a junior data analyst with the marketing analyst team, I am given the task to provide insights about how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently, and then provide recommendations to convert casual riders into annual members.

To answer the key business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share and act.

## About the Company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago

Cyclistic offers flexible pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. 

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Lily Moreno, the director marketing, advocates that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, she believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. 

## Ask
Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. 

There are three questions that will guide the future of the marketing program:
1.	How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? 
2.	Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships? 
3.	How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members? 

>**Business Task:** Analyze Cyclistic’s historical trip data for the year 2020 to identify trends and understand how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.
